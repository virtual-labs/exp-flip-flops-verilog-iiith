1. To demonstrate the practical implementation of positive and negative edged D flip-flops using the Verilog hardware description language.

2. To enable learners to simulate and analyze the behavior of D flip-flops using software tools.

3. To foster a deeper understanding of how D flip-flops can be used to build more complex sequential circuits.
