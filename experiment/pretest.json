      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
      "a":"This does not give required behaviour",
      "b":"This configuration ensures that the SR flip flop behaves as a D flip flop, where the D input controls the state of the flip flop.",
      "c":"Setting the S input to 0 (logic low) means the flip flop will be always in the reset state, regardless of the D input",

      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
          "a":"D=0 retains previous state and D=1 gives 0",
          "b":"D=0 retains previous state and D=1 flips the previous state",

      "explanations": {
          "a":"In a positive edge-triggered D flip-flop, the output changes only at the positive edge of the clock",
          "b":"a positive edge-triggered D flip-flop, the output changes only at the positive edge of the clock.",
          "c":"In a positive edge-triggered D flip-flop, when D=1, the input value is stored and reflected at the output only at the positive edge of the clock. At the negative edge of the clock, the flip-flop retains its previous value and does not change",

      "explanations": {
          "a":"In a D flip flop, the output Q_plus is equal to the input D.",
          "b":"n a D flip flop, the output Q_plus is not the complement of the input D",
          "c":"The output Q_plus is not dependent on the current state of Q.",
